# Suggest Edits

Show what you'd change in `$ARGUMENTS` using tracked-changes notation. Do not modify the file.

## Process

1. **Load the taste skill.** Internalize the editorial standards.

2. **Read the target file** at `$ARGUMENTS`.

3. **Produce a marked-up version** of the text using tracked-changes notation:
   - ~~Strikethrough~~ for deletions
   - **Bold** for additions/replacements
   - Show changes in context — reproduce the full text with marks, don't list changes separately

4. **Be ruthlessly helpful.** Apply every rule from the taste skill: kill AI patterns, tighten hedging, replace corporate bloat, fix robotic structures. Preserve substance, specifics, links, and the writer's actual point.

5. **Add a brief summary** after the marked-up text: what categories of changes were made and why.

## Rules

- **Never modify the file.** You have Read access only. This is a preview tool.
- **Preserve the writer's voice and style** as much as possible while improving clarity and impact.
- **Focus on prose quality**, not structure. Don't reorganize sections or rewrite whole paragraphs — show surgical edits.
- The user reviews your suggestions, then either applies them manually or runs `/edit` to rewrite in place.
