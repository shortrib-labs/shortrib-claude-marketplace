# Critique

Give feedback on the file at `$ARGUMENTS`. Do not modify any files — this command is read-only by design.

## Process

1. **Load the taste skill** by reading `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/taste/SKILL.md`. Internalize the taste profile and style rules.

2. **Read the target file** at `$ARGUMENTS`. Read it twice — once for substance, once for voice.

3. **Write feedback in three sections:**

### What Works

Quote the strongest passages directly. Say *why* they work — what makes the sentence land, why the structure serves the argument, where the voice is sharpest. Be specific. If nothing works, say so.

### What Doesn't

Name the problems. Don't rewrite — suggest direction. For each issue:
- What's wrong (be specific: which paragraph, which sentence, which pattern)
- Why it's wrong (which voice rule it violates, or why it fails on its own terms)
- Where to go (a direction, not a destination — "tighten this" not "change it to X")

Common things to flag: AI patterns that survived, hedging, filler, bullets where paragraphs belong, flat openings, missing specifics, sentences that explain what they just said.

### The Shape of It

Whole-piece assessment. Does the structure serve the argument? Is it the right length? Does it earn its opening and land its ending? Is there a through-line or does it wander? Would you want to read this?

## Rules

- **Never modify the file.** You have Read access only. If the user wants edits, they run `/edit`.
- **Write the feedback in voice.** Tight, direct, no filler. The critique should demonstrate the standard it's measuring against.
- **Be honest.** If the piece is good, say so briefly. If it needs work, say where and why. Don't soften bad news with compliments.
